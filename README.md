nodejs-hello-world
==================

Tiny hello world application for testing cloud deployment of node.js apps at Hetzner.

Currently using it to test a CD pipeline through Cloudbees DEV@Cloud through AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

Deploy it, and then browse:

	http://server/hello/world

Had fun demonstrating to Ernst.
